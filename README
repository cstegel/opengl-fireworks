# Project Overview: Fireworks

This is an OpenGL project that aims to model fireworks.  It is my final project for UW's CS 488 course.


# Dependencies

The only external dependencies are OpenAL and ALUT which are are already installed
on UW's graphics lab computers.  On Ubuntu 14.04 you can add these with the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev libalut-dev
```

The rest of the dependencies are pulled in automatically when building the project and my
course submission has these dependencies already pulled in.


# Compilation

To compile the program, run the command "make" within the root directory of the project.

The program will be compiled to "bin/Release/fireworks".
The program can then be run with "./bin/Release/fireworks".

This program was compiled/run successfully on graphics lab computer 13 (gl13).


# Objectives

  1. modelling the scene
  2. UI
  3. texture mapping [1]
  4. bump mapping [2][6]
  5. shadows using shadow maps [4][5][9]
  6. shadow map antialiasing using Percentage-Closer Filtering [8]
  7. volumetric light scattering as a postprocess effect [3]
  8. triggered sound where volume decays with distance
  9. kinematics system (gravity, velocity, acceleration)
  10. particle emitters (collections of temporary 2D sprites affected by kinematics


# Controls

The mouse can be toggled on with the "~" key (the one to the left of the "1").  You can then
open up the debug menu to toggle various options as well as change the display mode.

You can move around in the world with the WASD keys, spacebar, CTRL, and by moving the mouse.

Clicking the mouse will launch a firework into the air.
