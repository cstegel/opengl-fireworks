# Project Overview: Fireworks

This is an OpenGL project that aims to model fireworks.  It is my final project for UW's CS 488 course.

# Dependencies

This project has many external dependencies but the only ones that you have to install on your system are OpenAL and ALUT (these are already installed on UW's graphics lab computers).  On Ubuntu 14.04 you can add these with the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev libalut-dev
```

The rest of the dependencies are pulled in automatically when building the project.

# Compilation

To compile the program, run the command "make" within the root directory of the project.

The program will be compiled to "bin/Release/fireworks".  The program can then be run with "./bin/Release/fireworks".

This program was compiled/run successfully on graphics lab computer 13 (gl13).
